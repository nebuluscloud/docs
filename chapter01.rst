Overview of NebulusCloud
==============================

NebulusCloud is a managed file sync and share solution. It differentiates from other file sync and share solution by focusing on the security, control and team collaboration. NebulusCloud does really well in the following areas:

   1. maintain security and permission of NTFS permission on files and folders
   2. provide on-demand access that honors read-only, and write permission in real-time.
   3. mirror local network share to team collaboration in the cloud


NebulusCloud is a cluster of web services built on top of the Microsoft Web Platform. It provides file access and sharing functionality through client agents for PCs, Macs, File Servers, Web Browsers, and Mobile Devices.

The services can be deployed in flexible combinations to meet different needs. There are two primary ways to deploy the NebulusCloud solution.

    1. deploy NebulusCloud solution in the same network as the File Server and Active Directory server, in  a single company deployment mode.
